     * Gets the vacation options.
     *
     * Gets the vacation options for the given criteria. Prices are in pounds sterling, but for a
     * real application these should be currency agnostic.
     *
     * First, calculates the difference between the earliest and latest start dates. This is used
     * as the range to value when generating an observable which emits all the possible vacation
     * days within the client's specified range. Next, generate an observable which emits all the
     * possible cities excluding the city of departure:
     * `.fromIterable(City.values().toList()).filter { it != fromCity }`. Then using `flatMap()`,
     * map each city to each of the possible vacation dates. 'flatMap()` is again used to map
     * each city/date option to a zipped observable, which is the real meat of this method and the
     * point of the entire example.
     *
     * Remember that zip assumes each event emitted by the upstream observable is related to each of
     * the events emitted by each of the other upstream observables in the zip operation. As such,
     * three streams are zipped, each emitting zero or one event. Provided all three emit an event,
     * the result is used to build the vacation and emit it downstream. If one of the streams does
     * not emit an event, the others will be discarded and the next event processed. If one of the
     * streams completes, this is propagated downstream and all others complete too. Although this
     * example uses the events emitted from each stream to build the [Vacation] object, an
     * alternate implementation may completely disregard each of these results. in Kotlin, `_` can
     * be used to indicate that a lambda input value is not used, e.g.: `{ _, _, _ -> ::Vacation }`.
